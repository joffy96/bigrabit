                    <h2>BiGRABiT brings the power of IoT and real-time proximity solutions to healthcare</h2>
                    <p>
                        Enabling hospitals and clinics to improve operational efficiency, patient care, and safety. Our platform combines smart devices, BLE beacons, and gateways with an easy-to-use web application that provides actionable insights for administrators, doctors, and facility managers.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Patient Flow &amp; Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our system allows healthcare providers to track patient movement from check-in to discharge. Real-time dashboards show waiting times, consultation durations, and movement across different departments. This data helps reduce bottlenecks, improve scheduling, and enhance the overall patient experience. Patients can also receive navigation assistance inside large hospitals, guiding them to the right department or ward without confusion.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Staff Efficiency &amp; Safety</h3>
                    <p>
                        With BiGRABiT’s tracking system, hospitals can monitor staff availability and activity in real time. This ensures that critical staff such as doctors, nurses, and technicians are allocated where they are needed most. Proximity alerts can also be configured for restricted zones, ensuring compliance with safety and hygiene regulations while protecting both staff and patients.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Asset &amp; Equipment Tracking</h3>
                    <p>
                        Expensive and life-saving equipment such as wheelchairs, ventilators, infusion pumps, and diagnostic tools can often be misplaced or underutilized. Our solution enables real-time location tracking of these assets, minimizing search time, preventing theft or loss, and ensuring optimal utilization. The web application provides reports on asset usage, helping in better inventory planning and cost savings.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Emergency &amp; Compliance Management</h3>
                    <p>
                        In critical situations, every second matters. BiGRABiT enables quick detection of emergency situations such as overcrowding, unauthorized access, or missing patients. The platform integrates with security alerts to notify staff instantly. Additionally, hospitals can maintain compliance with government safety norms through automated reporting and digital audit trails.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Data-Driven Insights</h3>
                    <p>
                        All data captured by our proximity devices flows into a centralized web application. Hospital administrators can view heatmaps of patient traffic, staff distribution, and asset movement. Predictive analytics further support decision-making, helping management anticipate peak hours, allocate resources, and improve operational workflows.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By combining advanced IoT hardware with intelligent software, BiGRABiT equips healthcare providers with the tools they need to run safer, smarter, and more patient-centric facilities.
